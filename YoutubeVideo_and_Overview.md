# Difficulties that I faced:
The hardest part about this game was not randomizing the cells, but assigning that identity to the cell. Essentially, I made the grid as a list, and I indexed the list and assigned values to each cell. Making the intitial list with lists within it was not hard, but the part that took me a while to get was indexing that list and appending a random value to each list within the main list, so that the total identities in the main list would cover only the N by N grid. Another part that took a bit of time was figuring out how to allow for user input and classify each cell. I simply just reasearched different ways to generate number values or letter values per cell, and I was able to find some things that really helped me out.

# What did I enjoy?
Other than playing the game now that it's written, I really enjoyed learning new things about python and figuring out how to incorporate it into this project.

# Did I finish?
I wouldn't say I finished the project 100%. I would've really liked to make this game using pygame, but I found plenty of difficulty doing that, and it took me a lot longer than expected, so I wasn't able to use pygame. However, I was able to use the shell to customize how the user wants to play (allowing the user to select any size grid). I am still currently working on the pygame version, and once I get the basics of pygame down, I don't think it should be too hard, since I wrote the code here. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this project, I learned a lot of new things, and it definitely put my skills to the test!
