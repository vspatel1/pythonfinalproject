Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have figured out how to code the game and run it on the IDLE Shell (without using pygame). I have also looked into pygame a little bit and downloaded it, in hopes to be able to make this game in pygame.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to find out more information on how to use pygame and to be able to make the game in pygame (which I don't think will be too hard since I have the general code for the game figured out).

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
It is difficult to add options such as how big you would want the grid to be (rather than just give the player a the same grid everytime, with randomized identities for each grid block). One part that I have completed that took a while was figuring out how to get user input to select a grid block, since on shell the block is not clickable. Now, moving onto pygame, it is a little more difficult to get an idea of how to code the game using pygame, but I am in the process of reading more about how to use pygame and watching videos on it as well.
